# 1) filter the dataset to only include the obs that member_status start from 1 to 0
# 2) Create the new variable named "Duration" to count how many member_status = 1
# 3) aggregate all the variables (Event_Participation + Benefit_Usage + SC.BusinessDevelopment + SC.Outreach + SC.Visibility + SC.Talent +SC.Advocacy + SC.Engagement + SC.Benefits + SC.General) How the service were used in the membership duration time.

```{r}
final_data <- read.csv("/Users/jamesturner/Desktop/Tech Council/Our Datasets/final_data_withcate.csv")

# aggregate all rows when member_status =1 for each company and also aggregate all the behaviors variables for each rows, and also calculate all the how many member_status = 1 for each company, based on this to create a variable named Duration equal to how many 1 total then aggregate all rows when member_status = 0 for each company and also aggregate all the behaviors variables for each rows. how to make the duration for member_status =0, if I want to do the surviavl model to learn about how membership survival? it should be one dataset.
